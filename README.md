# TrailFeathers

Trail Feathers is an app for hiking and bird watching anywhere in the world! Use it to explore hiking and biking trails, organize lists of items to bring with you, and search for any North American bird.

# Application Walk Through

The idea is to have one stop shop for all your hiking needs, with a focus on Louisiana.

When a user opens the application they will be brought to the login page where they will be redirected to google to login.

Located at the top right of every page is a navigation burger menu which contains {x} options that will quickly navigate the user to various features of the application. From left to right are the ...

## Trips
Allows the user to view their upcoming and past trips

### Quartermaster
Allows user to create packing lists with just a name of the list and a description, after which the list is displayed on the page.
User can click on a given list which will open a new view; and there, the user can add items that they want for that trip/packing list.

### Birding Check List
A searchable checklist of all the bird in Louisiana (according to eBird a Cornell run Bird Data API). This includes the bird's common name, scientific name, common family name, and common scientific name. Users can check any bird they have spotted along there journey to keep along the trail.

Search Trails is a feature for searching by latitude and longitude for hiking trails all over the world. It utilizes an external api form rapidAPI.

Setup Photo upload - using cloudinary a user can take and upload photos on to their own profile or trail profiles.

### database:

We have a mySQL/Sequelize database. We have all of our models located in database/models. The database/index.js file is currently structured to work with an Amazon RDS online database. See setup below.

### server:

We have an express server. It is set up in server/index.js. All routes, with the exception of the birdSighting and BirdList routes, are stored in server/index.js. The bird routes are stored in server/routes.

### authentication

Our authentication is handled with oauth and passport. Our passport and google strategy setup can be found in server/middleware/auth.js. Once logged in, the user has access to the whole site.

### apis

We used several external apis for this project:

- RapidAPI - Trail API - https://rapidapi.com/trailapi/api/trailapi/
   This API allows us to search for any trails in the world based on latitude and longitude. It requires an API key and registration through RapidAPI, but both are free.

- Cloudinary API - https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference
   This api allows users to upload photos onto their profiles and on trail profiles. It requires credentials, but the entire setup is free for what we've used in this project.

- BirdSightings API - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59?version=latest
   This api allows users to search for any bird species and receive data about that specific bird. It is maintained by Cornell University and is free.

- Google Maps API - follow Google API instructions below and enable Google Maps API & Google Places API in your Google API console

<h2 align='left'>GOOGLE API</h2>

- Go to google api console website https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Click create and name the project
- Go to the project and name your app
- When you receive client ID and client secret, place these values in your .env file

### front-end

The front-end was built using React and React Router. In App.jsx we initialize our trail data so that upon refresh of trail profile, the most recent trail data is rendered. In that same file we route our links and routes for the app.

The HashRouter can be found in client/index.jsx

The styling is found in main.css and mapStyles.js.


# Dev Setup:

### Environment Variables Needed

#### Google Auth
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

#### Cloudinary & Image Hosting
- CLOUDINARY_NAME=
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
- CLOUDINARY_URL=

#### Trail API
- X-RapidApi-Key=
- X-RapidAPI-Host=

#### AWS RDS Database (online DB)
- RDS_HOSTNAME=
- RDS_USERNAME=
- RDS_PASSWORD=
- RDS_PORT=
#### Weather API

## Google OAuth

Google Oauth requires a google cloud account. First create your account and then navigate to the developer console. Go to google API and create a clientID and clientSecret. Your redirect URI should match what's in the server/middleware/auth file. These api keys go inside the .env file.

## WEATHER API SETUP
- create an account @ https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
- look at their availble API options at https://openweathermap.org/api
	- Subscribing to their One Call API "Pay as you call" option is nice for testing purposes. There are 2000 free calls to the api per day and we never had to exceed more than 500.
	- Instructions on how to set the parameters on their API call can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3
	- You can find/generate your API key by going to your profile > My Api kEY
	- From there you can see your daily API call usage by going to Billing Plans > View Usage Statistics

## AWS RDS DATABASE SETUP
- To create an online database to be accessible anywhere, you will need to have an AWS account and have IAM users set up.
- Then you will need to create a database through RDS. Save your username and password for the database. You will need them for the next step. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html
- Once your database is live, you will need to go to your RDS dashboard, go to Databases and access your live database. Retrieve the Endpoint, Port, and update your VPS security groups to include SSH requests from relevant IP addresses.
![RDS Setup](mockups/RDS-setup.png)
- To be able to see the live data in your database, you will want to download Mysql Workbench. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
- Once downloaded, create a mysql connection with any Connection Name and input your Endpoint as the Hostname, Port, the Username you created when you setup your Database, and the password. Click Test Connection to test whether the setup work. If it throws an error, you likely need to update your inbound security rules in your security group in the RDS dashboard.
![RDS Setup](mockups/RDS-setup-workbench.png)
- Update your .env with the Endpoint(HostName), Username, Password, and Port.
- Once your mysql connection works and your .env is completed, seed the database from your VScode terminal. You can then refresh your Schemas in the Workbench and see the TakeAHike Schema with the seeded tables. To view the data in that table, hover over it and click the far right spreadsheet icon.

## Installation/Start-up

- First fork the repo and clone it to your local machine.
- Collect all env keys
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- (if using local mysql) Open mysql, create and use a database called 'TakeAHike'
- (if using RDS) Update .env to match your RDS specs
- Run `npm run dev` to start Webpack
- Run `npm run seed` to seed Database
- Run `npm start` to run the server

### Known Bugs

- If you input a non-land based coordinate when searching for trails, it will return an error.
- If a user logs in, the redirect does not send the user back to the app, instead you have to hit back in the browser.
- The user profile pulls the first record from the database, not necessarily the 'logged in' user.
